### Notes
* Ruler Bug Fix details:
  * When the game parses an empty argument (no argument) in a trigger, if it is the first character of a value, the game will throw an error and ignore the command.
  * This presented an opportunity to simplify the code. Hence, there are now:
    * six different change ruler effect scripts: **brs_update_ruler**, **brs_update_ruler_min**, **brs_update_heir**, **brs_update_heir_min**, **brs_update_consort**, and **brs_update_consort_min**; and
    * three different check ruler trigger scripts: **brs_check_ruler**, **brs_check_heir**, and **brs_check_consort**.
