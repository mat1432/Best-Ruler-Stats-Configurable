# To Do List
## Fix Current Bugs
* Through nested scripts, the tooltip for changing a template shows the current stat target. I don't know how to fix this.
## Improve Features
* Change ludicrous mode to slightly dynamic of 3 tiers. 0-20, 0-50, and 0-100. I know how to do this, with a little bit of work.
  * This will improve performance slightly for anyone targetting 21-50.
  * This will remove the need to enable ludicrous mode.
## New Features
* Multiplayer / Global Restriction configuration menu
  * This allows a GM to define minimums, maximums, stat types, or enforce a profile globally.
  * Likely, the only way to access the menu is with a command, likely 'event brsmp.1'
