# To Do List
## Todo
* Test my mod!!!
  * Test that my cross scope variable manipulations work!!
## Fix Current Bugs
* Through nested scripts, the tooltip for changing a template shows the current stat target. I don't know how to fix this.
## New Features (Good luck ever seeing these added!!)
* Multiplayer / Global Restriction configuration menu
  * This allows a GM to define minimums, maximums, stat types, or enforce a profile globally.
  * Likely, the only way to access the menu is with a command, likely 'event brsmp.1'
